`WebCmsComponentModelService` and `WebCmsComponentModel`
`WebCmsComponentType`

The persisted entity is implemented by `WebCmsComponent`, but usually you will want to work with the `WebCmsComponentModel`.
The latter represents the entire strongly typed model ready for rendering, whereas the former only has the raw attributes.
