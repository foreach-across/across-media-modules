### Building from source
The source can be built using [Maven][] with JDK 8.

### Local development

Some tests are AWS specific, they require [Localstack][] with the S3 service to be running.
Some tests are Azure specific, they require [Azurite][] with the blob service to be runnning.
A `docker-compose` file is available in the root of this repository, running `docker-compose up` should start the required AWS and Azure services with data being stored in `local-data/storage/localstack` & `local-data/storage/azurite`.

 > On macOS you might have to do `TMPDIR=/private$TMPDIR docker-compose up` to workaround tmp dir issues.

In order to start the test application in development mode with support for one of the cloud providers an additional profile is required, `azure` for azure support and `aws` for aws support.
